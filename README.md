# sen

Since I started using docker, I always dreamed of having a docker TUI. Something like [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig), [htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/) or [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot). Some appeared over time. Such as [docker-mon](https://github.com/icecrime/docker-mon) or [ctop](https://github.com/yadutaf/ctop). Unfortunately, those are not proper docker TUIs. They are meant for monitoring and diagnostics.

So I realized that if I want make my dream come true, I need to do it myself. That's where I started working on *sen* (*dream* in Slovak).
